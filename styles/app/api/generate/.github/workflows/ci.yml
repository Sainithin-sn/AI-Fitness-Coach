      # 2) Set up Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js

          node-version: "20"

      # 3) Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
        # npm ci is deterministic and uses package-lock.json. It fails if lockfile doesn't match package.json.

      # 4) Build the Next.js app
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build

      # 5) Optionally run lint/tests (uncomment if you add tests/lint)
